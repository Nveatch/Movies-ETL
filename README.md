## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this "Movies-ETL" assignment was to create an automated pipeline for Amazing Prime on movie data and ratings from 3 files:

*Deliverable 1: An ETL function to read the 3 data files

*Deliverable 2: Transformation of Wikipedia data added to function

*Deliverable 3: Transformation of Kaggle data and merging of tables added to function

*Deliverable 4: Code to export tables to PgAdmin added to functions
